STUDYING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR & SHOPPING HABITS ANALYSIS FOR TARGETED MARKETING STRATEGIES

This is my second EDA made studying the following problem statement:
1. Are there specific times of the year when particular product categories exhibit higher performance?
2. Do specific product characteristics or promotional activities have a notable impact on both purchase volumes and review ratings?
3. Do particular age groups or genders show a preference for specific product categories or shopping channels?
4. In what ways can this data be utilized to create more focused marketing strategies?

I have also applied codes to describe the data, cleaning the data, manipulate the data, as well as producing graphical representation to further answering the problem statement.

Working further, I have created a Power BI Dashboard for the analysis that was done in the Jupyter Notebook for further clarification on the variables that are observed. I have uploaded the dashboard in pbix files as well as pdf file for reference.

Do let me know if there;s anything I can work on to improve on this notebook! :)
