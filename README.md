STUDYING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR & SHOPPING HABITS ANALYSIS FOR TARGETED MARKETING STRATEGIES

This is my second EDA made studying the following problem statement:
1. Are there specific times of the year when particular product categories exhibit higher performance?
2. Do specific product characteristics or promotional activities have a notable impact on both purchase volumes and review ratings?
3. Do particular age groups or genders show a preference for specific product categories or shopping channels?
4. In what ways can this data be utilized to create more focused marketing strategies?

I have also applied codes to describe the data, cleaning the data, manipulate the data, as well as producing graphical representation to further answering the problem statement.

Do let me know if there;s anything I can work on to improve on this notebook! :)
